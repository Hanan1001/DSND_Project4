### Project CRISP-DM
**Project Business Understanding**: <br> 
In this project we analyze Seattle's AirBnB data to ansewer our business needs of understanding reviews, fininding pricing trends and predicting the prices.  <br> 
**Data Understanding** <br> 
In the project's [juniper notebook](https://github.com/Hanan1001/DSND_Project4/blob/master/project4.ipynb) we analyzed the three CSV files of [Kaggles' Seattle AirBnb Data](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data). we understoood our data through exploring its tables, contents and visulizing them. <br> 
**Prepare Data** <br> 
In the project's [juniper notebook](https://github.com/Hanan1001/DSND_Project4/blob/master/project4.ipynb) we prepared our data by scurbbing off the Null values, cleaning categorical data, dropping columns that didn't coorelate or impact our business needs and finally we standerized data that needed standerization.  <br> 
**Data Modeling** <br> 
In the project's [juniper notebook](https://github.com/Hanan1001/DSND_Project4/blob/master/project4.ipynb) we chose regression as our model and we explored three regression models. Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Random Forest Regressor.  <br> 
**Evaluate the Results** <br> 
We enterpretted our results using regression cooeficients, to find out what attributes mostly impact on the element 'Price' a detailed evaluation of the results is documented in  the project's [juniper notebook](https://github.com/Hanan1001/DSND_Project4/blob/master/project4.ipynb) <br> 
### Instalation 
Project has been created using Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda framework. 
Since this project is for the Data Science Nanodegree, we used machine language packages like sklearn, panada, numpy..etc
### About the project
This project allows the student to explore the business needs using data available on Kaggle. 
For this project we selected Seattle's AirBnB Data and explored 3 business needs, reviews, price trends and price prediction.
we tried three models and evaluated two models.
The results were intrigunig and gave us an insight on the factors impacting price.
### Acknowledgements
I would like to give my gratitude to MiSK Academy for giving me the opportunity to pursure the DSND and my gratiture to the team at Udacity for their hardwork and efforts in cooredinating such a program.
